# Welcome to my LeetCode-Workpage

Here is where I store all my solutions for various questions in Leetcode.

## Organizaton of the Workpage
The repository will have folders, each based on the programming language used to solve the LeetCode question.

The files within the folders will be named q-#### to describe the question number they are listed on LeetCode.com. (Example: q-0013 would be question number 13)

The file will begin with a comment segment of the Question and the test cases provided. I will also provide a link to associated Leetcode question so others can see the full question including pictures, diagrams and other testcases.

After, the solution code, typically a function, will be posted along with a test case to prove correctness.

Then, the code explination and time/space complexities will be written below the code as a comment.

### I hope you enjoy my solutions and contact me for any clarifying questions! Thank you!
